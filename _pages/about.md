I am a third year PhD student at the Laboratory for Sciences of Climate and Environment LSCE, in France. I currently work on methods for quantifying record probabilities in a changing climate. My research interests include statistical climatology and hydrology and extreme value theory, with a particular focus on extreme climatic and hydrological events.
